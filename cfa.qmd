## Data

As the data is openly licend available on github, we can directly download it.

```{r}
cfa_data <-
  read.csv(
    paste0(
      "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/",
      "sammerk/did_data/master/cfadata.csv"
    )
  )
```

## Particpants

In the study *N* = `{r} nrow(cfa_data)` students participated.

## Measurement

We assessed the two independet variables risk and adjustment with three indicators each using $\tau$-generic measurement models.

```{r}
#| warning: false
library(lavaan)
model <- 
    "adjustment =~ motiv + harm + stabi
     risk =~ ppsych + ses + verbal"

model_fitted <- cfa(model, data = cfa_data)

model_fit <- fitmeasures(model_fitted)
```

This resulted in fitindices beyond the often arbitraryly used  [@mcneish2021] benchmarks (CFI = `{r} round(model_fit["cfi"], 3)`)
